# Text


##  Usage for App UI

This is `Text` atom, used to insert text in our software UI. 
We have 6 types of interface's text, indicated by `as` prop:

- `heading-1-interface`
- `heading-2-interface`
- `heading-3-interface`
- `heading-4-interface`
- `body-interface`
- `body-small-interface`

And could be bold, italic or normal depending on `variant` prop:

- `bold`
- `normal`
- `italic`

The `color` prop can receive one of the following values:
- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `blue-white`
- `red-white`
- `warning`
- `error`
- `success`

`as = 'heading-1-interface'` use this on the software and project titles

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Story
    name="heading-1-interface"
    args={{
      as: "heading-1-interface",
      variant: "bold",
      children: "welcome to structuraid",
      color: "primary"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

`as = 'heading-2-interface'` use this on the software and project titles

    }}

      as: "heading-3-interface",

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Story

    args={{
      as: "body-interface",
      variant: "normal",
      children: "Reinforced concrete footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and to transmit and distribute their loads to the soil. The design is based on the assumption that the footing is rigid, so that the variation of the soil pressure under the footing is linear. Uniform soil pressure is achieved when the column load coincides with the centroid of the footing. Although this assumption is acceptable for rigid footings, such an assumption becomes less accurate as the footing becomes relatively more flexible."

`as = 'body-small-interface'` use this on the software and project titles

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>

### Colors

Depending on `color`prop, we have:

- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `blue-white`
- `red-white`
- `warning`
- `error`
- `success`
